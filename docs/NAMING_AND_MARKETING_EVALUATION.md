# Naming, Domain & Marketing Evaluation

Research-based recommendations for your freelance business setup.

---

## 1) Name: Real Name vs Brand Name

### Legal Reality in Germany

According to [firma.de](https://www.firma.de/en/company-formation/how-to-name-your-einzelunternehmen/), as a **Freiberufler or Einzelunternehmer**:

> Your business name **must be your full legal name** on all official documents and invoices.

You **can** use a trading name (Geschäftsbezeichnung) for marketing:
- Website
- Business cards
- Social media
- Email signatures

But invoices, contracts, and official correspondence = **your real name**.

### My Recommendation

| Approach | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Real name** | Invoices, contracts, legal docs, Impressum |
| **Trading name** | Website URL, branding, marketing |

**Best strategy**: Use your real name prominently + a simple tagline.

Example:
> **Max Mustermann**
> Automation & Internal Tools

This is:
- Legally compliant
- Builds personal trust
- Easy to remember
- No trademark conflicts

---

## 2) Domain Recommendation

### Option A: Your Name (Recommended)

```
vorname-nachname.de
vornamenachname.de
nachname.dev
```

**Pros:**
- Unique, no competition
- Personal brand = trust
- Works for B2B consulting
- Available forever (it's YOUR name)

**Cons:**
- Hard to "sell" the business later (irrelevant for now)

### Option B: Descriptive Name

```
automation-dev.de
code-automation.de
prozess-automation.de
```

**Pros:**
- SEO for keywords
- Sounds more "company-like"

**Cons:**
- Generic, forgettable
- Harder to get good .de domains
- Trademark risk

### Option C: Creative Brand

```
rapidcode.de
blitzdev.de
fastflow.de
```

**Pros:**
- Memorable
- Scalable if you hire later

**Cons:**
- Trademark research needed
- Harder to trust for B2B

### My Verdict

**Go with your real name.**

Reasons:
1. You're testing the market — don't invest in branding yet
2. Personal name = trust in B2B consulting
3. Zero trademark issues
4. You can always add a brand later

**Domain extensions to consider:**
| Extension | Cost/Year | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `.de` | ~10€ | Best for German clients |
| `.dev` | ~15€ | Tech credibility |
| `.com` | ~12€ | International |

**Buy at:** [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com), or [INWX](https://www.inwx.de) (German registrar)

## 3) Advertising: Pay or Not?

### Research Summary

From [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organic-marketing) and [ZealousWeb](https://www.zealousweb.com/blog/paid-ads-vs-organic-marketing-2025-strategy/):

> "For freelancers, organic strategy is the most effective way to build long-term relationships."

> "You don't need paid ads to get consistent freelance clients. What you do need is a smart system for being discoverable."

### Recommendation: **NO paid ads initially**

| Channel | Verdict | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Google Ads | ❌ Skip | Expensive, wrong audience for B2B services |
| LinkedIn Ads | ❌ Skip | €5-10 per click, burns budget fast |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads | ❌ Skip | B2C focused, wrong audience |

**Instead, invest time in:**
1. LinkedIn organic posts (free)
2. Freelancer platforms (free profiles)
3. Local networking (free or cheap)

### When to Consider Paid Ads

Only after you have:
- 3+ successful projects
- Testimonials
- Clear offer that converts
- Budget you can lose (€500+/month)
