In my current role, I'm responsible for several production systems: data processing, sync services, admin panels, and a customer portal. My approach: clean architecture, clear separation of layers, maintainable code. I use AI-assisted development as a tool, not a replacement for solid principles like DRY and SOLID. What I offer: replacing manual processes with software, connecting systems, processing data reliably.",
